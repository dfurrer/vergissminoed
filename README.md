Our app recommends you items to put on your to-buy Migros list. The suggestions are based on the
intelligent analysis of your shopping history (i.e. Migros Cumulus data), while our models are
learned from the data, and can thus incorporate changing consumer behavior, out-times
(e.g. holidays) and uncertainty (e.g. through global models based on shopping histories of the
other consumers).

We programmed a prototype front end for Android smartphones as well as a prototype back end on
Google Cloud Platform. The software was tested on real data as well as on plausible generated data.
